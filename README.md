[Hatchet](https://github.com/llnl/hatchet) is a Python-based library that allows [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) dataframes to be indexed by structured tree and graph data. It is intended for analyzing performance data that has a hierarchy (for example, serial or parallel profiles that represent calling context trees, call graphs, nested regions’ timers, etc.). Hatchet implements various operations to analyze a single hierarchical data set or compare multiple data sets, and its API facilitates analyzing such data programmatically.

If you are new to hatchet and want to start using it, please check out the documentation [here](https://llnl-hatchet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

This repository contains materials for Hatchet's hands-on tutorial. You can do
all of the exercises on your own laptop using BinderHub.


### Running the notebooks online

We use [BinderHub](https://mybinder.org) to create a shareable and interactive
environment of the notebooks within a live JupyterHub instance.

You can access the interactive environment at this
