Hatchet is a Python-based library that allows [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) dataframes to be indexed by structured tree and graph data. It is intended for analyzing performance data that has a hierarchy (for example, serial or parallel profiles that represent calling context trees, call graphs, nested regionsâ€™ timers, etc.). Hatchet implements various operations to analyze a single hierarchical data set or compare multiple data sets, and its API facilitates analyzing such data programmatically.

This repository contains materials for Hatchet's hands-on tutorial, covering
basic to advanced usage. You can do all of the exercises on your own laptop
using BinderHub.


### Running the notebooks

We use [BinderHub](https://mybinder.org) to create a shareable and interactive
environment of the notebooks within a live JupyterHub instance.

You can access the interactive environment at this
[link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hatchet/hatchet-tutorial)
or by clicking the badge at the top of this file.
