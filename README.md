[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hatchet/hatchet-tutorial/main)

Hatchet is a Python-based library that allows [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) dataframes to be indexed by structured tree and graph data. It is intended for analyzing performance data that has a hierarchy (for example, serial or parallel profiles that represent calling context trees, call graphs, nested regionsâ€™ timers, etc.). Hatchet implements various operations to analyze a single hierarchical data set or compare multiple data sets, and its API facilitates analyzing such data programmatically.

This repository contains materials for Hatchet's hands-on tutorial. You can do
all of the exercises on your own laptop using BinderHub.


### Running the notebooks online

We use [BinderHub](https://mybinder.org) to create a shareable and interactive
environment of the notebooks within a live JupyterHub instance.

You can access the interactive environment at this
[link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hatchet/hatchet-tutorial)
or by clicking the badge at the top of this file.


### Running the notebooks at NERSC

To run the notebooks on Cori, you will need to install Caliper, create a conda
environment with Hatchet and its dependencies, and install the environment so
that it can be accessed in JupyterHub.

To build and install Caliper:

    $ git clone https://github.com/hatchet/hatchet-tutorial
    $ cd hatchet-tutorial
    $ ./build_and_install_caliper

To setup your local conda environment with Hatchet and its dependencies:

    $ module load python
    $ conda create --name hatchet-sc21-env python=3.8
    $ conda install ipykernel multiproces
    $ source activate hatchet-sc21-env
    $ pip install hatchet==1.3.1a0

Lastly, we install our conda environment so we can use it in JupyterHub:

    $ python -m ipykernel install --user --name hatchet-sc21-env-jupyter

To access the notebooks, navigate to https://jupyter.nersc.gov, and switch to
kernel "hatchet-sc21-env-jupyter" in the kernel list.
