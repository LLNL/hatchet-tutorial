The **Query Language** finds all paths in a call graph that match properties described by the query applied to profiling data. It enables Hatchetâ€™s Jupyter notebook-based interactive visualization to provide users with a simple and intuitive way to massively reduce the profiling data interactively. The **Query Language** has two dialects (Object-based Dialect and String-based Dialect), that simplify its use under diverse circumstances. 

## Category 8: Predicate Combination through Other Operations (e.g., XOR)

Category 8 expands on combining query predicates through exclusive disjunction or exclusive OR with the `XOR` logical operator. The Hatchet base Query Language allows us to use more complex logic than AND, OR, and NOT in query node predicates. A complex logic we explore in this notebook is `XOR`.
