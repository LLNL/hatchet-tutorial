The **Query Language** finds all paths in a call graph that match properties described by the query applied to profiling data. It enables Hatchetâ€™s Jupyter notebook-based interactive visualization to provide users with a simple and intuitive way to massively reduce the profiling data interactively. The **Query Language** has two dialects (Object-based Dialect and String-based Dialect), that simplify its use under diverse circumstances. Hatchet also supports eight different categories for the **Query Language**, as shown in Fig. 1.  

|Category ID|Category Description|
|:---------:|:-------------------|
|1          |Quantifier Capabilities|
|2          |String Equivalence and Regex Matching Predicates|
|3          |String Containment Predicates (contains, starts with, ends with)|
|4          |Basic Numeric Comparison Predicates (==, >, >=, etc.)|
|5          |Special Value Identification Predicates (NaN, Inf, None)|
|6          |Predicate Combination through Conjunction (AND)|
|7          |Predicate Combination through Disjunction and Complement (OR, NOT)|
|8          |Predicate Combination through Other Operations (e.g., XOR)|

Hatchet offers multiple interfaces to define queries with different trade-offs to verbosity and expressiveness. An entire catalog of queries, use cases, categories and capabilities can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fKNlHmDJdDbnE4jyMcaFqdnw6ZSaexgm33rOcVAj0do/edit#gid=0).

Hatchet query language consumes a GraphFrame and a sequence of queries. Each query can comprise a **predicate** and a **quantifier**. Hatchet query language finds all **matching paths** from a provided GraphFrame. For example, in Fig.2, for the query (any with A or B), the output would comprise of 2 paths, [1, 2, 4] and [1, 3, 4].

## Category 1: Quantifier Capabilities

A valid hatchet query requires a **quantifier**. The accepted values for query node quantifiers in the **Object-based Dialect** are:

1. `"."`: Match a single node
2. `"*"`: Match 0 or more nodes
3. `"+"`: Match 1 or more nodes
4. `Integer`: Match an exact number of nodes
