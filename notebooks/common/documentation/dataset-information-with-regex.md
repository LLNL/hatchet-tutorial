### Loading profile data as Hatchet GraphFrame

Hatchet queries are only defined on Hatchet GraphFrames. 
Obtaining a hatchet GraphFrame is straight forward:

1. Import hatchet
2. Import [python regular expression operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) 
3. Use the appropriate reader for the profile/trace at hand

We first load a [Caliper](https://github.com/LLNL/Caliper) profile in JSON format, where Caliper is a performance profiling library developed by the Lawrence Livermore National Lab (LLNL).

This example profile is profiled from [LULESH (Livermore Unstructured Lagrangian Explicit Shock Hydrodynamics)](https://asc.llnl.gov/codes/proxy-apps/lulesh), a performance report data generated by Caliper. LULESH is a highly simplified application designed to solve the Sedov Blast problem, which is a standard hydrodynamics test problem. It performs a hydrodynamics stencil calculation using both MPI and OpenMP to achieve parallelism. 

This is an interesting profile because it covers a relatively large number of nodes (45 nodes) and spends considerable time in MPI communication routines.
