### Query type 1: Check if numeric metric is NaN in query node predicates

This query type allows a user to identify GraphFrame nodes with a NaN value. When a user subtracts or divides two GraphFrames that don't contain the same nodes, the nodes that are not present in both GraphFrames are changed to hold **NaN** values. An example of this can be seen on Fig. 1 below.

**Figure 1**: Visual example of GraphFrame operations that produce nodes with NaN value.


Such query type covers cases where an operation on GraphFrames produce nodes with NaN as their value. The ability to filter the resulting GraphFrame allow users to focus on nodes that aren't shared between the GraphFrames. 

Here, we use the second profile dataset stored as "gf1" for a `subtraction of GraphFrames`. Given that the only difference between the node names of the two profiles is that one GraphFrame does not contain any MPI nodes, the resulting GraphFrame must contain MPI nodes with nan value for their time metric.
