The **Object-based Dialect** is a formal language that is built around Python’s built-in objects. Queries are composed using Python’s list, tuple, and dict built-in data structures within **Object-based Dialect** of Hatchet query language. 

## Category 2: String Equivalence and Regex Matching

Category 2 expands on query predicates by exploring string equivalence and regex matching. The Object-based Dialect of the Hatchet Query Language allows us to:

1. Check for string metric equivalence in query node predicates
2. Check for regex match on string metric in query node predicates
