### Use Case 3: Match one or more nodes

This query type filters a GraphFrame with the object syntax to find all query paths with one or more nodes that meet a query predicate. 

The notebook contains two examples for this query type. The purpose of the second example is to illustrate the difference between the query types that `match zero or more nodes` and `match one or more nodes`.

**Example 1:**

For the first example, the metric used for the query is `name` and the predicate is that the `name` metric `starts with "CalcMonotonic"`.
