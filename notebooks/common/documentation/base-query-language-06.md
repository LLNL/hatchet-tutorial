The **Query Language** finds all paths in a call graph that match properties described by the query applied to profiling data. It enables Hatchetâ€™s Jupyter notebook-based interactive visualization to provide users with a simple and intuitive way to massively reduce the profiling data interactively. The **Query Language** has two dialects (Object-based Dialect and String-based Dialect), that simplify its use under diverse circumstances. 

## Category 6: Predicate Combination through Conjunction (AND)

Category 6 expands on combining query predicates by combining them with the `AND` logical operator. The Hatchet **base Query Language** allows us to use intersection (AND) in query node predicates.
