The **Object-based Dialect** is a formal language that is built around Python’s built-in objects. Queries are composed using Python’s list, tuple, and dict built-in data structures within **Object-based Dialect** of Hatchet query language. 

## Category 4: Basic Numeric Comparison Predicates (==, >, >=, <, <=)

Category 4 expands on query conditions by exploring predicates that compare numerical metrics of performance data. An example of a numerical metric is "time". The Object-based Dialect of the Hatchet Query Language allows us to:

1. Evaluate numeric metric comparison (e.g., greater than) in query node predicates
2. Check for numeric metric equivalence in query node predicates
