The **Query Language** finds all paths in a call graph that match properties described by the query applied to profiling data. It enables Hatchetâ€™s Jupyter notebook-based interactive visualization to provide users with a simple and intuitive way to massively reduce the profiling data interactively. The **Query Language** has two dialects (Object-based Dialect and String-based Dialect), that simplify its use under diverse circumstances. 

## Category 2: String Equivalence and Regex Matching

Category 2 expands on query conditions by exploring string equivalence and regex matching. The Object-based Dialect of the Hatchet Query Language allows us to:

1. Check for string metric equivalence in query node predicates
2. Check for regex match on string metric in query node predicates
