The **Query Language** finds all paths in a call graph that match properties described by the query applied to profiling data. It enables Hatchetâ€™s Jupyter notebook-based interactive visualization to provide users with a simple and intuitive way to massively reduce the profiling data interactively. The **Query Language** has two dialects (Object-based Dialect and String-based Dialect), that simplify its use under diverse circumstances. 

## Category 4: Basic Numeric Comparison Predicates (==, >, >=, <, <=)

Category 4 expands on query conditions by exploring predicates that compare numerical metrics of performance data. An example of a numerical metric is "time". The Hatchet **base Query Language** allows us to:

1. Evaluate numeric metric comparison (e.g., greater than) in query node predicates
2. Check for numeric metric equivalence in query node predicates
