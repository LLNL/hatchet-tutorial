### Query type 2: Check if numeric metric is not NaN in query node predicates

This query type allows a user to identify GraphFrame nodes that `do not contain a NaN value`. Such queries allow users to focus on nodes that are shared between the GraphFrames after an operation is carried out between two GraphFrames.
