**Example 2:**

For the second example, we repeat the second example in the previous section but replace the final query node to 'match one or more nodes'. The first quantifier (`"."`) constrains the filter to single node with the predicate that the metric `name`, `starts with lulesh`. The second quantifier (`"."`) all nodes matching any node, before only `matching one or more nodes` that satisfy the predicate that the metric `name`, `starts with Calc`.
