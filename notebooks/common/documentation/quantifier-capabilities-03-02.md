**Example 2:**

For the second example, we re-use the second example from the previous section but replace the final query node to 'match one or more nodes'. The first quantifier (`"."`) constrains the filter to a single node with the predicate that the metric `name`, `starts with lulesh`. The second quantifier (`"."`) selects all single nodes, before only `matching one or more nodes` that satisfy the predicate that the metric `name`, `starts with Calc`.
