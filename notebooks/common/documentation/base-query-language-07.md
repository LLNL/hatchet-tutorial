The **Query Language** finds all paths in a call graph that match properties described by the query applied to profiling data. It enables Hatchetâ€™s Jupyter notebook-based interactive visualization to provide users with a simple and intuitive way to massively reduce the profiling data interactively. The **Query Language** has two dialects (Object-based Dialect and String-based Dialect), that simplify its use under diverse circumstances. 

## Category 7: Predicate Combination through Disjunction and Complement (OR, NOT)

Category 7 expands on combining query predicates through disjunction with the `OR` logical operator and taking the complement of query predicates using the `NOT` logical operator.

The Hatchet base Query Language allows us to use:

1. Union (OR) in query node predicates
2. Negation (NOT) in query node predicates
